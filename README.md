# Probot semver

> A GitHub app built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that provides automatic semantic versioning support.

## Features

When you push a tag:

* If there are open issues in the corresponding milestone, an issue detailing them is automatically created and assigned to the user who pushed the tag.

When you publish a [release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/):

* The milestone for the release is automatically closed.
* Milestones for the next major, minor, and patch releases are automatically created, if they don't yet exist.
